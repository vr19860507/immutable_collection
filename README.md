# Immutable collections

Immutable collections that compare as value types.

- Immutable `List<E>` as `IList<E>`.
- Immutable `HashSet<E>` as `ISet<E>`.
- Immutable `HashMap<K, V>` as `IMap<K, V>`.

See an [example](https://github.com/vr19860507/immutable_collection/blob/master/example/main.dart) for details.


If you want immutable data classes and discriminated unions that compare as value types, you might use [data classes and discriminated unions](https://pub.dev/packages/adt).
